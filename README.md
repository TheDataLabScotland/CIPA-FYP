=============================
This is code from a final year project performed using similar information to
that we'll be using in the enian project. From Philip Bruner's email:
"For background, I also attach Ryan Mansoorâ€™s FYP from Imperial College, 
which draws some relevant conclusions. Ryan completed this report as part 
of his Final Year Project (FYP) under our guidance- it builds on previous 
work funded by TDL and draws some relevant conclusions that can inform our 
approach. "

We also have the final report stored in ../../00_Background/FYP_Final_Report(1).pdf
